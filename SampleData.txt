She understands my hair type and knows exactly what to do with my hair.  She keeps a record of my previous visits.  She recommends what is best for my hair.  She is pleasant to work with: easygoing, friendly, and respectful.  I've been going to her since 2008.  I'm really picky with hair people, and I used to go back to Chicago for haircuts.  Now, I stick to Marilo.", "type": "review", "business_id": "70p94Ejeu1v5XlIkbKORYQ"}
